General Functionality
=====================

**Content Type and Communication**      
 The API accepts and returns all results in JSON. Some resources also additional URL parameters to add additional specificity to a request.

**Errors**
 When an error is encountered when completing a request, the API returns a JSON object with the HTTP status code and a message describing the error of the form:

::

  {
   "status": <http_status_code>,
   "error": <error message>
  }

**Pagination**
 API Routes that fetch many objects return them in a JSON array and support paging through subsets of the total result set. When there are additional results for the query, access to them is populated in a 'Links' HTTP header. This header has the form: 

::

 "Links" : <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="next <http://<EVERGREEN_HOST>/rest/v2/path/to/resource?start_at=<pagination_key>&limit=<objects_per_page>; rel="prev"

**Dates**
 Date fields are returned and accepted in ISO-8601 UTC extended format. They contain 3 fractional seconds with a ‘dot’ separator. 

**Empty Fields**
 A returned object will always contain its complete list of fields. Any field that does not have an associated value will be filled with JSON's null value.

The API has a series of implemented objects that it returns depending on the queried endpoint.
